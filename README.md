This is literally just a mirror of the calculator on the cmdr's toolbox website that i made so I can bypass the school blocks should the website get blocked
<br>**DON'T USE THE RELEASE. [USE THE WEBSITE](https://potatoprogram.github.io/EDFleetCarrierCalculator/).**<br>
I can't promise the release files will work as intended. I only made the release because I felt like it
## Main Release Patch Notes ##
#### New features ####
- Monthly upkeep is now calculated
- Yearly upkeep is now calculated
- Jumps/week can now be factored into upkeep

#### Fixes/Changes/QoL ####
- Carrier cost and core services are now factored into cost and upkeep, respectively
- Module fitting cost is now located under "Installation Cost of Modules"
- Module-only upkeep will not be calculated as there is no instance of upkeep without core service upkeep
- Images have now been added to all modules with the exception of the Refuel, Repair and Restock modules

#### Coming Soon (maybe) ####
- Individual module cost, displayed ideally next to the modules themselves.
