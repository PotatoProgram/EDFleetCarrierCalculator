# EDFleetCarrierCalculator #
This is literally just a recreation of the calculator on the cmdr's toolbox website that i made so I can bypass the school blocks should the website get blocked
#### Update 1 ####
- Mass calculation is bugged out (low-priority, will fix upon implementation of odyssey modules)
- Cost does not include fleet carrier purchase cost (5,000,000,000 cr), or core services upkeep (5,000,000 cr)
##### Todo #####
- QoL on module status toggles
- implement Odyssey modules (duh)
- (Eventually) fix mass calculation problem
- (Potentially) add individual module stats, e.g. module cost, upkeep, and mass
- (Potentially) add recommendations and extra, to the tune of [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18rJ1p0ll9vW0nf1A-YHD47FT4lFm72JbiSnIWsRfVsg/edit?usp=sharing)
